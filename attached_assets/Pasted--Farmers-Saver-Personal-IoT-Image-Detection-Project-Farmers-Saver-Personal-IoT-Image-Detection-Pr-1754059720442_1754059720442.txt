Tech: Python, OpenCV/TensorFlow Lite, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Linux Bash, USB Camera, PyAudio

Designed an edge-AI system on Jetson Nano to detect pigeons raiding livestock feed and automatically scare them away with an audio alarm.


- Built a real-time pigeon-detection pipeline in Python using OpenCV / TensorFlow Lite. Trained a lightweight model that runs at 10 fps on Jetson Nano with < 5 % false-positive rate in farm conditions.

- Integrated a USB camera and Linux-based scripts to capture video frames, run inference, and trigger a loudspeaker alert within 200 ms of detection.

** Developed automated audio alarm** (Python + PyAudio) that plays custom repellent sounds whenever the model detects pigeons within the camera’s field of view.

- Deployed on a small-scale farm: has maintained ≥ 95 % uptime over six months of field testing, reducing feed loss by over 60 % during peak bird season.

- Ongoing improvements: Currently refining model robustness (adding nighttime IR detection) and optimizing power consumption (switching to sleep mode when idle).
