Metadata caching - Reduces function introspection from 770ms to ~50ms
Timezone caching - Optimizes timezone queries from 4674ms to ~10ms PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md:154-167
Strategic indexing - Optimized indexes for booking queries database-optimizations.sql:124-127
Calendar Synchronization 
External calendar integration is optimized through background cron jobs rather than real-time API calls CALENDAR_OPTIMIZATION_README.md:14-19 :

Background sync - Updates every 30 minutes via cron
Instant loading - Calendar data loads in <100ms
Database caching - Pre-computed blocked dates stored in PostgreSQL
